<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ishaan Agrawal. I am a 20 year old bachelor staying in Birtamode city of Nepal. I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in 
  Technology from National Institute of Technology, Warangal and I have successfully managed to complete my 2 years of engineering.
  My father's name is Shiv Kumar Agrawal. He is a renowned businessman and a philanthropist. Not to make my profile sound boring, here 
  I include my hobbies and interests. Check that out!
</p>

<p>Mobile has been a captivating source in my life and my major free time goes in watching contents displayed on one. Saying sth 
  this way can have a negative impact on my profile but it is what it is. To say in a simpler way, I love and enjoy watching movies,
  web series, and reels. I also devote myself to sketching, which is once in a blue moon still I consider it as a hobby. My
  interest, huh, love interests are on the cards but for now, just getting laid off periodically(Hahaha, just kidding).
</p>

<p>Next, I would like you all to know what my dream is. I am still in a skeptical phase of my life, which I think most of the people
  are when it comes to deciding the career. I want to use all my education as an engineer, to do something bigger and achieve accomplishments
  and fame across the world. I want to have a lavish, luxurious and a prosperous life ahead and keep paving the road that leads me to that.
